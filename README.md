Wafflehacks 2022 Project. Art and Music Track

A website designed to help calm the minds of anxious people. Listen to soothing music alongside gentle rain sounds. This site also has a built in breathing exercise to help you get to a peaceful state of mind.

This is my first hackathon submission and also my first time truly finishing a website using html, css, and javascript!
